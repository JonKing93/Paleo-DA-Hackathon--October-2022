Outline
=======
In this section, we will examine two classes that facilitate working with state vector ensembles. This section contains the pages:

:doc:`ensembleMetadata`
    We'll begin with an overview of the ``ensembleMetadata`` class. This class provides a number of utility functions for working with state vector ensembles, and will appear throughout the rest of the tutorial.

:doc:`ensemble`
    Next, we'll examine the ``ensemble`` class, which can be used to interact with state vector ensembles saved in ``.ens`` (ensemble) files.

:doc:`code6`
    Then, we'll do an open-coding session to practice the commands in the ``ensemble`` class and interact with our state vector ensembles.
