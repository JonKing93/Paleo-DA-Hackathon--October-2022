Outline
=======
In this section, we will examine the ``ensemble`` class, which can be used to interact with state vector ensembles saved in ``.ens`` (ensemble) files. This section contains the pages:

:doc:`ensemble`
    We'll begin with an overview of the key features of the ``ensemble`` class.

:doc:`code6`
    Then, we'll do an open-coding session to examine the commands in the ``ensemble`` class and interact with our state vector ensembles.
