Outline
=======

In this section, we'll explore the ``stateVector`` class, which is used to design and build state vector ensembles. The section includes the following pages:

:doc:`Concepts <concepts>`
    The process of designing state vectors will involve some new vocabulary, so we'll begin by introducing some new concepts for the design process.

:doc:`Indices <indices>`
    Next, we'll take a quick look "under-the-hood" to illustrate how the ``stateVector`` class builds and selects different ensemble members.

:doc:`code5`
    Finally, we'll move into the next open-coding session. We'll examine some of the key methods in the ``stateVector`` class, and then use the class to build a state vector ensemble.
