Outline
=======
In this section, we'll examine the ``PSM`` interface. This interface allows users to run proxy forward models using inputs from a state vector ensemble.

:doc:`psm`
    We'll start with an overview of the ``PSM`` interface. The interface is designed to allow users to run *external* forward modeling codes using state vector ensembles. We'll examine forward models officially supported by ``DASH`` and detail the main features of the interface.

:doc:`code7`
    We'll then move into the next open-coding session and will use the interface to generate proxy estimates for our proxy records.
