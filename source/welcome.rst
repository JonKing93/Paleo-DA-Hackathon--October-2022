Welcome!
========
Welcome to the Paleo DA Hackathon!

The goals of this workshop are to:

1. Introduce attendees to the DASH toolbox, and
2. Help attendees use the toolbox to implement their own assimilations.


Format
------
The workshop is designed to introduce attendees to DASH, a Matlab toolbox for paleoclimate data assimilation.  After an initial overview of the DASH toolbox,  the workshop will alternate between a series of short lectures and open-coding sessions. Each lecture will introduce a component of the DASH toolbox and demonstrate its use. The subsequent open-coding session will give attendees an opportunity to practice using the component for their own assimilations.
