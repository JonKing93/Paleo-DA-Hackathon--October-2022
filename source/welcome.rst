Welcome!

Welcome to the Paleo DA Hackathon!

The goals of this workshop are to:

1. Introduce attendees to the DASH toolbox, and
2. Help attendees use the toolbox to implement their own assimilations.

DASH is a Matlab toolbox designed to help facilitate paleoclimate data assimilation. After an initial overview of the DASH toolbox,  the workshop will alternate between a series of short lectures and open-coding sessions. Each lecture will introduce a component of the DASH toolbox and demonstrate its use. The subsequent open-coding session will give attendees an opportunity to practice using the component for their own assimilation.
