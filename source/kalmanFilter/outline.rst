Outline
=======

In our final section, we'll explore the ``kalmanFilter`` class, which we'll use to run a Kalman filter data assimilation algorithms. This section contains the pages:

:doc:`da-algorithms`
    We'll start with some brief comments about the data assimilation algorithms supported in DASH. brief summary of the data assimilation algorithms in the DASH toolbox. We'll also comment on the relationship of these algorithms with other classes in the toolbox.

:doc:`kalmanFilter`
    Then, we'll examine the ``kalmanFilter`` class in detail. We'll examine the essential inputs to a Kalman filter, see variations in the algorithm supported by the class, and explore the types of outputs produced by an assimilation.

:doc:`code8`
    In the final coding session, we'll use the class to run a Kalman filter assimilation for our datasets.
