Outline
=======

In our final section, we'll explore the ``kalmanFilter`` class, which is used to run Kalman filter data assimilation algorithms. This section contains the pages:

:doc:`kalmanFilter`
    We'll first give an overview of the ``kalmanFilter`` class. We'll examine the essential inputs to a Kalman filter, see variations in the algorithm supported by the class, and explore the types of outputs produced by an assimilation.

:doc:`code8`
    In the final coding session, we'll use the class to run a Kalman filter assimilation for our datasets.
